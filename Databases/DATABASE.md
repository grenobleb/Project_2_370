Our database system went through 3 primary changes.

Originally, we had planned for the system to run with a database from mongodb and pymongo, as it was the database system we were most familiar with because of the previous assignments and the last prject.
This was also chosen as we wanted to use a database that was not part of Anvil, just to make our system more complex.
The database was set up with the first region fully ready to be used. -- kanto_pokemon.json
We ended up unable to utilize this database software due Anvil requiring a subscription in order to allow us to use pymongo.
We wasted two of our three 7-day free trials messing with this system.

Next we had shifted to work with SQLite, as the group was at least familiar with SQL coding.
The mongodb database was also very quickly able to be retrofitted into the SQL format.
In additon, with th expectation for this to work, we ended up with all the generations finished. -- pokedex.db
We once again ended up unable to utilize this database software due to Anvil requiring a subscription in order to allow the use of ANY outside database system.
We wasted our last 7-day free trial on this roughly a week and a half prior to the due date, which meant - as none of us were in a state to be able to pay for the subscription for less than a week of use - we had to shift once again.

As of 12/11 (project due on 12/12) we shifted to our final version of the database, just using the built in default database
The default database does not allow the upload of files, and as such takes a much longer process to fill out the database.
With this we decided to reduced the scope of the project from all pokemon from the first three regions to just the starter evolution lines from each of the three regions (27 individual pokemon in total).
This is the final system we ended with.
